00:00.230 --> 00:04.560
All right so let's continue from where we left off in the previous video and what we're trying to do

00:04.560 --> 00:10.920
is we're trying to write another function which takes a sentence which is sent and encodes it into a

00:11.310 --> 00:12.800
list of ideas.

00:12.810 --> 00:19.410
So essentially take a sentence such as phone Sonja or whatever and translate it into something that

00:19.410 --> 00:20.680
looks like this guy here.

00:20.720 --> 00:24.140
So now we are trying to go into the forward direction.

00:24.360 --> 00:24.660
Right.

00:24.900 --> 00:32.070
So what this does is it simply gets that same dictionary which goes from word to ideas and then it splits

00:32.580 --> 00:36.300
the sentence that is given to us and gets each word out.

00:36.450 --> 00:42.530
And for each word it's going to appended to this encoded list right.

00:42.570 --> 00:44.040
So we had this list.

00:44.040 --> 00:49.200
Each word gets appended into this list if it is found in the dictionary if it's not found in the dictionary

00:49.230 --> 00:50.460
then it's an unknown word.

00:50.820 --> 00:55.670
And you would recall that we used to for unknown up above over here here.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.740
So we can do if an unknown is found.

00:58.740 --> 00:59.400
Right.

00:59.420 --> 01:03.020
So that is the ENCODE function and we simply take down the list.

01:03.020 --> 01:10.750
So if you use this function and take the sentence you will remember that this was the mapping so fun

01:10.750 --> 01:13.340
was 3 4 7 0 1 and so on.

01:13.420 --> 01:18.580
So if you tried to encode this sentence this sentence does not make any sense but we just want to see

01:18.580 --> 01:19.560
what it is.

01:19.600 --> 01:19.830
Right.

01:19.830 --> 01:22.990
So this would be fonts on your money et cetera.

01:23.110 --> 01:30.220
And this other sentence this does not look good translates to 14 1 2 7 24 168 and 52.

01:30.700 --> 01:37.450
So now that we have this what we want to do is we want to input this data into the model and there is

01:37.450 --> 01:38.510
a problem with that.

01:38.530 --> 01:40.540
Now the reviews can be variable length.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.370
You can have a review which is very short.

01:42.370 --> 01:45.860
You can have a review which can be very long and that poses a problem.

01:45.970 --> 01:52.990
How can we create the input layer which has a fixed number of nodes and give it a variable sequence.

01:52.990 --> 01:58.540
There are many ways to handle this but the way we are going to do this is simply by ensuring that all

01:58.540 --> 02:00.380
the sequences are the same length.

02:00.400 --> 02:01.840
There are three possibilities.

02:01.840 --> 02:06.700
For instance if we decide that on maximum length that we are going to feed into the machine is going

02:06.700 --> 02:07.450
to be maximum.

02:07.480 --> 02:13.270
So if we go up what it on maximum is 400 so we can only have 400 worldviews.

02:13.600 --> 02:19.270
What if we have a shorter review for instance a 200 word review.

02:19.270 --> 02:27.190
What we're going to do is we are going to pad them and we're batting does is essentially inserts zeros

02:27.580 --> 02:28.280
at the beginning.

02:28.480 --> 02:36.550
So if you're Max and is 400 as we have now and a review has 200 words then it's going to have 200 spaces

02:37.060 --> 02:41.460
added to the beginning and then 200 words review to make it a total of 400.

02:41.470 --> 02:46.890
So if you have a 400 word review that looks perfectly fine if you have a shorter review that gets padded

02:46.900 --> 02:52.300
with spaces in the beginning and if you have a review that is longer than 400 words then those are simply

02:52.300 --> 02:53.480
clipped away.

02:53.500 --> 03:00.970
So if 100 words is a sufficient length we decided that maybe you want to do a review on a larger set.

03:01.030 --> 03:03.580
So you might want to increase the max.

03:03.970 --> 03:06.070
Now where does this maximum come from.

03:06.070 --> 03:10.000
Sometimes you just know this for instance does it already has a limit.

03:10.030 --> 03:15.610
And if you're doing that analysis you can simply set this maximum to the maximum total and get us already

03:15.610 --> 03:18.850
has a function which does this batting for us.

03:19.510 --> 03:24.100
So if you go up a bit again and you would see that from catastrophic pre processing we have imported

03:24.100 --> 03:27.580
sequence and in the sequence we have a function which is called back sequence.

03:27.820 --> 03:36.170
So we can simply go ahead and use that so extra in is not going to be extreme padded up to this maximum

03:36.170 --> 03:39.240
length and expressed is also going to be the same thing.

03:39.240 --> 03:39.460
Right.

03:39.470 --> 03:45.320
So once we do that we are going to pad them and now we have twenty five thousand comma four hundred.

03:45.620 --> 03:50.930
So now this four hundred is the maximum that we have now if we take a look at extreme zero again you

03:50.930 --> 03:57.660
will see over here that is essentially the same thing except it has all of these zeros battered upfront.

03:57.740 --> 04:04.560
So after that it has the same one 14 22 et cetera but because it was shorter than 400 it is now better

04:04.590 --> 04:07.430
with a couple of zeros upfront.

04:07.430 --> 04:09.340
Now that we have the understanding of the data.

04:09.380 --> 04:14.840
Please make sure that you understand all of these concepts that we have seen because the actual machine

04:14.840 --> 04:16.340
learning portion is really easy.

04:16.400 --> 04:16.570
Right.

04:16.580 --> 04:20.540
So all we have to do for that is go ahead and create this model.

04:20.990 --> 04:23.000
And that's fairly easy.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.130
What's really complicated when you go into the real world and try to apply these concepts to your problems

04:28.190 --> 04:31.030
is this portion over here that you've covered up until now.

04:31.100 --> 04:35.690
So it's very important that you understand this if you have any questions please do ask and get through

04:35.690 --> 04:37.660
this as much as you can before you proceed.
