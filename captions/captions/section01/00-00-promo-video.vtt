Hi and welcome to this exciting course on sentiment analysis through deep learning with cactus and python.

00:05.310 --> 00:07.910
I'm Dr. Norman and I'll be your instructor for this course.

00:07.950 --> 00:12.180
I have a piece in computer science and a post doc and machine learning for security and privacy from

00:12.180 --> 00:14.130
Max Planck Institute for Software Systems.

00:14.280 --> 00:18.570
One of the world's leading research institutes I have more than 15 years of teaching experience and

00:18.570 --> 00:21.000
about two decades of programming experience.

00:21.060 --> 00:25.230
This course is about sentiment analysis which is one of those areas of machine learning that have immense

00:25.230 --> 00:27.180
importance from a business point of view.

00:27.270 --> 00:31.890
It helps businesses gauge how vending products are doing in the market and whether people liked their

00:31.890 --> 00:33.840
products and their company or not.

00:33.840 --> 00:38.310
It's also used by politicians and governments to decide whether their policies and stances have a good

00:38.310 --> 00:39.830
standing with the masses.

00:40.020 --> 00:41.310
Doesn't matter who you deal with.

00:41.340 --> 00:46.110
Everyone needs to know the sentiment of people about something they are doing or making.

00:46.110 --> 00:51.110
On the flipside Sentiment analysis is one of those ideas which are very poorly understood.

00:51.210 --> 00:56.400
People who are working on creating sentiment analysis techniques typically don't have a good understanding

00:56.400 --> 00:59.460
of how to write good sentiment analysis engines.

00:59.550 --> 01:04.320
They typically rely on outdated techniques and methods for doing sentiment analysis that requires a

01:04.320 --> 01:05.720
lot of effort.

01:05.760 --> 01:08.490
Yet it used very poor results.

01:08.490 --> 01:13.470
I'll give you an example if you search for sentiment analysis courses on any popular online course platform

01:13.740 --> 01:18.700
you can see that many courses tried to teach you sentiment analysis using techniques that are outdated.

01:18.750 --> 01:24.840
David tried to teach you about what words have a positive sentiment and how the grammar and center structure

01:24.840 --> 01:27.750
affects sentiment while all that is true.

01:28.280 --> 01:32.450
It's also a very inefficient way of doing sentiment analysis in the real world.

01:32.450 --> 01:36.780
The best way to do sentiment analysis in today's industry is through deep learning.

01:36.920 --> 01:39.190
You don't do sentiment analysis yourself.

01:39.200 --> 01:44.350
You train a machine to do it for you and this is the approach that we will take in this course.

01:44.670 --> 01:48.590
We will use deep learning to create a model that can do sentiment analysis for us.

01:48.600 --> 01:53.740
This will help us write a sentiment analysis engine in less than 60 lines of code.

01:53.850 --> 01:59.220
This engine will be able to perform industry grade sentiment analysis and can be scaled up very easily

01:59.520 --> 02:00.970
for large scale systems.

02:01.050 --> 02:05.130
In particular we will use Gatiss and Python for our deep learning purposes.

02:05.160 --> 02:10.590
The reasons are simple get us is by far the easiest deep learning tool gets to get started with it was

02:10.590 --> 02:15.990
developed independently by a Google engineer but since then it has been adopted by Google as the efficient

02:15.990 --> 02:17.390
front end defensive floor.

02:17.610 --> 02:21.660
Get us allows you to use many different backgrounds besides sense of flow as well.

02:22.110 --> 02:27.770
So if you work with get us you can switch easily between the A.C. anti-gay Amex and any future backing

02:27.810 --> 02:30.480
that might show potential in this course.

02:30.480 --> 02:32.810
We take an extremely practical approach.

02:32.880 --> 02:37.580
We learn everything through code so that you can immediately see how things are applied.

02:37.590 --> 02:40.520
There are two types of students that can benefit from this course.

02:40.540 --> 02:45.510
One if you have had some exposure to machine learning and possibly deep learning but aren't comfortable

02:45.510 --> 02:49.520
with applying the concepts in the word for sentiment analysis.

02:49.520 --> 02:52.560
At last making deep learning models seemed mystical.

02:52.560 --> 02:54.510
If so this course is for you.

02:54.510 --> 03:00.030
Second if you are a complete newbie to sentiment analysis but want to figure out how to learn it and

03:00.030 --> 03:05.460
then apply it without going through page loads of math then this course is for you as soon as the score

03:05.460 --> 03:09.980
starts we will immediately get recording a sentiment analysis engine and only come through the duty

03:09.990 --> 03:11.920
when it's absolutely necessary.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.190
Then after only the bare essentials a few days we will go back to campus and cover some essential concepts

03:17.190 --> 03:17.880
to get you started.

03:18.330 --> 03:22.530
This would include installation of us on Windows Mac and Linux and it will get you up to speed with

03:22.530 --> 03:23.830
the best practices.

03:23.910 --> 03:29.540
Then we will come back to our original less than sixty nine sentiment analysis engine and expanded fully.

03:29.610 --> 03:34.200
That way you get to code your engine first and see results and then understand how it works and how

03:34.200 --> 03:35.200
to extend it.

03:35.230 --> 03:40.900
Remember my plan through this course is not to cover all aspects of sentiment analysis or deep learning.

03:40.920 --> 03:45.070
I'm trying to give you a deeper feeling of why things work the way they do.

03:45.090 --> 03:49.620
Once you understand the contents of discourse you will be in a much better position to fast track to

03:49.620 --> 03:52.440
any material that you can find all through the course.

03:52.440 --> 03:57.330
I will share my experiences and guide you through the common stumbling blocks that faced a lot of time

03:57.330 --> 04:00.150
for people who are just getting started at the end of this course.

04:00.150 --> 04:04.170
You will get a certificate of completion that you can use to prove that you have a deep understanding

04:04.170 --> 04:05.610
of this bar for good.

04:05.760 --> 04:10.560
And since this course comes with a no questions asked 30 day money back guarantee you've got nothing

04:10.560 --> 04:11.360
to lose.

04:11.570 --> 04:13.550
So enroll now and I'll see you on the inside.
