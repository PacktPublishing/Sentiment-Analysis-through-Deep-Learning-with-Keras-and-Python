We've covered a lot of the tools that are provided by us to aid us in implementing deep learning models.

00:06.660 --> 00:10.010
However tennis is a very very powerful tool.

00:10.140 --> 00:15.870
It has a very simple front end and that makes people think that it doesn't have too much to offer.

00:15.870 --> 00:20.730
That's not true and I would like to bust this myth by pointing you to some resources that would really

00:20.730 --> 00:26.130
help you out in learning the intricacies of the Get Us architecture.

00:26.160 --> 00:30.900
So the first go to site for Qantas learning is to get us sufficient documentation.

00:30.900 --> 00:37.200
So I have opened this earlier as well but we have to get a start I over page which details to get us

00:37.200 --> 00:39.780
documentation in excruciating detail.

00:40.050 --> 00:41.910
So you have all the different things here.

00:41.910 --> 00:46.540
You have the code layers convolution layers pulling layers and you have different types of other lasers

00:46.560 --> 00:49.940
when it's so you can go ahead and take a look at these.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.420
Another very good resource is the get us blog.

00:52.740 --> 00:55.280
So it has quite a lot of technical details.

00:55.290 --> 01:01.830
And once you have gone through the course discourse that we are coming you should be able to understand

01:01.860 --> 01:05.250
almost all of the blog posts that are on here.

01:05.280 --> 01:11.790
So these are really good and they give you real life examples of how you can apply Deep Learning Deep

01:11.790 --> 01:13.540
Learning to your models.

01:13.560 --> 01:21.330
So this is the official blog written by the developer of kind of some self and it has quite a lot of

01:21.720 --> 01:22.920
very interesting articles.

01:22.920 --> 01:28.270
I'd like to really point out to a couple of those which can really help you understand the idea.

01:28.270 --> 01:33.660
So this article over here building powerful image classification models using very little data.

01:33.690 --> 01:38.860
This is a very useful model if you want to really understand how you can bring everything together.

01:38.880 --> 01:45.570
For instance you might want to load some bits that were saved by the Qantas people and then you bring

01:45.570 --> 01:51.300
together some models that were created by Qantas and you write a couple of lines of code and you get

01:51.300 --> 01:53.820
the power that Google machines can provide you.

01:54.730 --> 01:57.090
So that's a very good resource.

01:57.240 --> 02:02.630
Again since this was an introductory introductory course we have only covered the bare minimum of math.

02:02.640 --> 02:08.820
But if you do want to make machine learning your area of expertise or if you want to really make sure

02:08.820 --> 02:13.640
that you exploit its true potential you really do need to understand the math behind it.

02:13.650 --> 02:17.260
And I have a really good resource for that.

02:17.370 --> 02:23.370
This is Prof Nando freighters and he's a professor of computer science at Oxford University.

02:23.370 --> 02:29.250
He has two undergraduate courses and a graduate course on machine learning and those two are the best

02:29.250 --> 02:31.470
courses that you can find on the Internet for free.

02:31.890 --> 02:37.800
And they take you from scratch in terms of mathematical theory and they bring you to the State of the

02:37.800 --> 02:38.570
art.

02:38.640 --> 02:47.130
This is the guy who was a major contributor in torch the game changing framework in deep learning and

02:47.130 --> 02:50.640
many of his students have gone on to great heights.

02:50.790 --> 02:54.630
So we should really check out the courses by profit energy freighters and that would really help you

02:54.630 --> 02:58.380
out if you want to understand the state of the art.

02:58.410 --> 03:00.960
There are two conferences that you really should follow.

03:00.960 --> 03:02.060
One is nips.

03:02.070 --> 03:08.130
So you might want to go in here and take a look at the recent papers for for instance nips 2017 and

03:08.130 --> 03:13.430
you would realize that there are many things that you can apply to your own domains and a lot of codes

03:13.440 --> 03:15.510
for these are available so you can use them.

03:15.570 --> 03:18.520
And another very good conference is ICM in 2017.

03:18.660 --> 03:23.910
So you can take a look at the proceedings for that and you can look at the accepted papers and obviously

03:23.910 --> 03:25.860
the tutorials are very helpful too.

03:25.920 --> 03:27.990
So we'll keep exploring keep going back.

03:27.990 --> 03:35.730
Between back and forth between theory and code and hopefully you learn a lot to keep in touch with me

03:35.790 --> 03:37.480
through the real time check system again.

03:37.500 --> 03:44.650
I'll post a link on the course page to that and make sure that you share your experiences with us and

03:44.650 --> 03:45.510
do provide feedback.

03:45.690 --> 03:46.010
Thank you.
