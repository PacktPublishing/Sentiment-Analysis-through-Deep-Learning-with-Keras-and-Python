00:01.340 --> 00:06.680
In this video we're going to take a look at how to set up our environment for get a sentence on Mac

00:06.700 --> 00:11.990
and the next I'm on the Mac operating system but if you're on Linux the instructions are essentially

00:11.990 --> 00:13.150
the same.

00:13.250 --> 00:19.700
So you go ahead to Anaconda distribution and you download it from Anaconda dot com slash download.

00:19.700 --> 00:25.670
Now if you're on Linux it's highly recommended that you do not use the built in Python interpreter but

00:25.670 --> 00:26.570
install Anaconda.

00:26.570 --> 00:28.160
It's going to make your life a lot easier.

00:28.810 --> 00:34.290
So you'll go to your download page and download Python three point six game two point seven works but

00:34.370 --> 00:39.360
three point six is the recommended one you download it and install as per the instructions.

00:39.380 --> 00:43.030
It's a simple process of heading next after next.

00:43.040 --> 00:51.430
So once you have the anaconda distribution installed you need to go to a terminal and in any folder

00:51.430 --> 00:56.960
that you want you want to enter the command install virtual in.

00:57.580 --> 01:00.180
So this is going to install virtually and repackage for you.

01:00.190 --> 01:04.810
And what you're in these highly recommended if you want to work with machine learning because for a

01:04.810 --> 01:07.960
lot of prototypes they're going to ask for a specific version of a library.

01:07.960 --> 01:11.350
And if you install that Virgin is going to mess up the rest of the system.

01:11.380 --> 01:17.100
So you want to be in a virtual environment which perhaps everything up in a bubble.

01:17.320 --> 01:21.770
So whatever you do within that virtual environment is going to stay within that which you might like.

01:21.820 --> 01:23.440
So we need to install what you need me.

01:24.070 --> 01:27.460
I've already installed which within me so it's going to say a refinement to be satisfied.

01:27.460 --> 01:31.650
But if you just started by then three point six it's going to set it up for you.

01:31.700 --> 01:35.010
After that you want to a fortune in wheat and cactus.

01:35.010 --> 01:40.670
So it is going to create a new virtual environment by the name of of in the current working directory.

01:40.890 --> 01:43.750
Again I've already created this which would in wheat.

01:43.750 --> 01:45.370
So you should enter.

01:45.400 --> 01:46.660
I'm going to hit backspace.

01:46.870 --> 01:51.220
And then we offer the virtual environment has been set up you need to do this for you.

01:51.730 --> 01:56.890
Now what you want to do is you want to activate it in order to activate it to see a source then slash

01:56.960 --> 02:02.140
activate within this gets formed within you watch it and then for that it's going to activate your environment

02:02.170 --> 02:09.060
and the indication of that is that it's going to be the environment name over here.

02:09.150 --> 02:18.120
Now we want to install Jupiter tend to flow and get us all three of them to enter and they should be

02:18.120 --> 02:18.510
installed.

02:18.540 --> 02:22.230
So I wanted to install them so it's saying all the requirements are satisfied.

02:22.250 --> 02:24.930
And for you it will go ahead and it started off the Internet.

02:24.930 --> 02:30.360
Once you have that you want to start to get a notebook and this is going to start up our Jupiter notebook

02:30.400 --> 02:38.050
and our default problem browser and you will see that we have on the phone over here.

02:38.140 --> 02:46.970
Now what you want to do is you want to go ahead and download the zip file which includes all the notebooks

02:47.000 --> 02:50.960
and the courses on here and you want to copy all three of these

02:53.720 --> 02:59.050
and paste them in your virtual environment that you just created.

02:59.140 --> 03:06.190
So so that they are available for you over here and then you can go ahead and take a look at this in

03:06.190 --> 03:12.230
order to test that the environment is working you got a new and Python 3 and simply insert one come

03:12.230 --> 03:12.890
on over here.

03:12.910 --> 03:18.730
So you say in import it's important to get us or shift it enter.

03:19.120 --> 03:26.620
And if it works fine even though it's saying something about it in conflict for I think three point

03:26.620 --> 03:29.320
sixty three point seventy three point five and three point six.

03:29.920 --> 03:33.220
It's just a warning and it's it's fine if you get this one.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.560
So we got this output over here.

03:35.560 --> 03:37.310
No error that means we're fine.

03:37.460 --> 03:41.110
Now the environment is setup and we can go ahead and start doing some code.
