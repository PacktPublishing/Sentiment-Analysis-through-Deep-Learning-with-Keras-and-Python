00:01.180 --> 00:07.180
In this video and the next we're covering the installation of Paris with the dance floor beckoned so

00:07.180 --> 00:10.490
that we can get started with our code.

00:10.580 --> 00:15.470
First we'll take a look at windows and in the next videos we're going to take a look at the installation

00:15.470 --> 00:17.180
for Mac and Linux.

00:17.180 --> 00:21.790
Now I must warn you that I'm going to give you step by step instructions on installation of getters

00:21.830 --> 00:24.190
with denser flow back and on Windows.

00:24.260 --> 00:29.510
But if you're serious about pursuing machine learning I strongly recommend that you get access to a

00:29.510 --> 00:34.790
Linux or a Mac machine because Windows doesn't seem to have to go to full support.

00:34.790 --> 00:39.980
There are many restrictions that you need to follow and the community simply doesn't support Windows

00:40.010 --> 00:44.370
as much as it does on Linux and Mac so and said that.

00:44.570 --> 00:48.910
Let's start with the installation of Windows and right off the bat.

00:48.920 --> 00:51.420
There are some limitations.

00:51.530 --> 00:57.860
So first you must have a 64 bit operating system so you should have a 64 bit processor and a 64 bit

00:57.860 --> 01:03.620
operating system installed Windows 10 is recommended but you can also go with Windows 8.

01:04.720 --> 01:06.140
And that should work.

01:06.140 --> 01:11.760
So once you have ensured that you are on a 64 bit operating system 32 bit will not work next.

01:11.810 --> 01:14.740
I've spent a lot of time trying to make it work on 32 bit.

01:14.750 --> 01:16.320
And it's it's a huge headache.

01:16.700 --> 01:22.350
So make sure you have a 64 bit operating system and then go ahead and download the anaconda distribution.

01:22.550 --> 01:28.400
So if you work with Python before you might be wondering if the deformed Python dot org distribution

01:28.400 --> 01:32.630
is OK so it's ok but Anaconda makes your life a lot easier.

01:32.630 --> 01:37.880
So I strongly recommend that you go with Anaconda so you can go ahead and download Anaconda for Windows

01:38.120 --> 01:43.250
and what you want is the python three point six version again you need the python three point six million

01:43.280 --> 01:48.490
two point seven would not be sufficient to install any airflow so you need to download this.

01:48.570 --> 01:53.240
And and it's a simple wizard it installs very easily.

01:53.240 --> 01:55.600
You just need to head next next next.

01:55.610 --> 02:01.330
So once you have Anaconda installed you go to your start menu and you start the anaconda.

02:01.490 --> 02:03.780
Not even those come on point but the anaconda prompt.

02:05.390 --> 02:10.190
So once you're in the anaconda prompt the first thing that you need to do is install virtual enemy.

02:10.220 --> 02:16.940
So you say they've installed virtual and we now what this virtual in WI does is it creates a virtual

02:16.940 --> 02:21.440
environment for you and you work within this virtual environment.

02:21.440 --> 02:26.780
The reason for recommending virtual environment is that there are going to be a lot of laboratory incompatibilities

02:26.810 --> 02:31.490
when you work with machine learning code for instance you might download a piece of code from the Internet

02:31.520 --> 02:35.890
that works really well but requires a specific vision of a library which conflicts with everything else

02:35.900 --> 02:42.080
you have to watch you'll envy is going to help you wrap it up in a bubble and keep it in its place.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.620
So we need to install virtual indeed.

02:43.640 --> 02:48.390
If you've just started which an can not be installed and you can install it with on which I mean we

02:48.890 --> 02:50.770
as you can see I have already installed it.

02:51.080 --> 02:57.590
So it's going to say that the requirement is already satisfied notable but for you it will install it

02:57.790 --> 02:59.000
for the Internet.

02:59.010 --> 03:04.930
Now the thing that we need to do is create a virtual environment so that's what you're in we get us.

03:04.970 --> 03:09.950
You can give it any name but we want you to give it a name of get us or get a Steve forget test.

03:10.130 --> 03:14.630
You hit enter and it's going to create a virtual environment for you and put a python executable in

03:14.630 --> 03:15.070
there.

03:15.170 --> 03:20.560
Again I've done this before so I'm not going to hit enter I'm going to simply assume that you hit enter

03:20.570 --> 03:26.930
and now you have a get a Steve hold it installed here by virtually and then you need to going to get

03:26.930 --> 03:34.730
a steep and you can do the eye out over here and you will see that there is a scripts folder here within

03:34.730 --> 03:40.160
the scripts folder is and activate the script once you hit that you will notice that this Kristie has

03:40.160 --> 03:40.980
not appeared a lot here.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.860
This means that you have no debug in within the virtual environment get a steep and anything that you

03:45.860 --> 03:50.900
do any installation that you do any python uses that you do is going to be built in this virtual environment.

03:50.900 --> 03:53.950
So now you are in your bubble.

03:54.290 --> 04:03.830
So let's go ahead and install install get us into flow and Jupiter which we need all three of these

04:04.330 --> 04:05.020
again.

04:05.150 --> 04:06.870
This is going to install quite a few packages.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.030
What I've done this before.

04:08.180 --> 04:14.060
So you hit enter and it's going to make the installations and I've already done that once you have that

04:14.120 --> 04:16.500
you can go ahead and say Jupiter notebook.

04:17.210 --> 04:22.310
So when you hit Jupiter notebook enter this is going to open up a new environment for you within your

04:22.310 --> 04:23.450
browser.

04:23.450 --> 04:28.910
Now if you haven't worked with Jupiter notebook and it's a very very useful tool to have under your

04:28.910 --> 04:33.440
belt if you're working in data science or machine learning it lets you experiment with Betancourt really

04:33.440 --> 04:34.140
easily.

04:34.280 --> 04:36.290
And it's a very user friendly environment.

04:36.290 --> 04:42.050
So once you enter the command it's going to automatically open up the spot for you and you can interact

04:42.050 --> 04:45.230
with your scripts through this browser environment.

04:45.230 --> 04:48.070
So the first thing that we need to do is make sure our case is working.

04:48.110 --> 04:50.550
We go to Neal and we had Python 3.

04:50.570 --> 04:55.230
So it is going to create a new blank notebook for us untitled notebook.

04:55.250 --> 04:59.050
We can call it get a test or anything that you want.

04:59.120 --> 05:07.490
This is just for testing purposes so we can say import Qantas hold down shift and hit enter and there

05:07.490 --> 05:12.020
you go using tons of low back end and it star right now.

05:12.050 --> 05:18.370
Let's wait until this becomes a one so that we can be sure that Qantas has been installed properly intensive

05:18.370 --> 05:20.450
principle is working correctly.

05:20.900 --> 05:29.340
So any minute now so once we have this working We sure that get us has been installed and supply is

05:29.340 --> 05:31.420
installed and everything is working properly.

05:31.440 --> 05:41.760
Now you go ahead and download the zip file from the core speech and this is going to be it is going

05:41.760 --> 05:48.150
to give you these three folders right so notebooks has all the notebooks that we want to work with and

05:48.630 --> 05:52.060
we have some data scripts and we have an empty Data folder.

05:52.140 --> 05:53.550
So this supposed to be empty.

05:53.610 --> 05:56.090
So we extracted our zip file and you got this.

05:56.160 --> 06:00.930
And now what we want to do is we want to open our get a Steve folder on order here.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.870
So this is simple end users no one get a Steve.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.940
So we don't hear Steve or end user someone get a Steve.

06:06.960 --> 06:10.070
And we want to copy all three of these.

06:11.520 --> 06:13.050
We want to copy all three of these

06:15.800 --> 06:21.430
and based them over here so that they're available in our Jupiter environment.

06:21.440 --> 06:24.910
So we close this page you go ahead.

06:24.950 --> 06:26.450
And now these are available.

06:26.450 --> 06:31.570
You can go ahead and do the notebooks and open our second notebook and execute it.

06:31.610 --> 06:38.810
So this means that our environment is ready and we can go ahead and use our system for working with

06:38.920 --> 06:39.650
us.

06:39.710 --> 06:44.580
Now in my videos that follow I'm going to be working on a Mac.

06:44.600 --> 06:51.290
But as long as you have followed these instructions the notebooks should be working well just as it

06:51.290 --> 06:54.380
is on windows as they are working on a Mac.

06:54.410 --> 06:54.860
See you there.
