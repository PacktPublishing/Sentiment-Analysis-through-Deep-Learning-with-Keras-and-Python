WEBVTT

00:00.270 --> 00:00.590
All right.

00:00.600 --> 00:03.330
So in the last video we took a look at progression.

00:03.390 --> 00:08.920
We took a look at the terminology and we predicted some real valued outputs.

00:08.940 --> 00:13.150
So now what we want to do is we want to go ahead and do a little bit of classification.

00:13.290 --> 00:16.270
So what we want to do is we want to predict class.

00:16.320 --> 00:23.040
So what that means is if you remember the example that we did earlier on Father psychic learn we wanted

00:23.040 --> 00:32.640
to predict whether this image this guy over here whether it's a 0 a 1 or 2 or 5 up to 9.

00:32.640 --> 00:32.820
Right.

00:32.820 --> 00:34.110
So which one of these is it.

00:34.110 --> 00:36.190
So obviously we know that it's a five.

00:36.240 --> 00:37.770
But does the machine know.

00:37.830 --> 00:43.410
So this is an example of classifications what we want to do is want to predict a discrete value saying

00:43.410 --> 00:46.560
that this number is one point five would make no sense.

00:46.590 --> 00:46.790
Right.

00:46.800 --> 00:49.610
So we can only have zeros and then a jump.

00:49.680 --> 00:52.500
1 2 2 9 right.

00:52.500 --> 00:53.570
So discrete values.

00:53.850 --> 00:56.070
So this is called classification.

00:56.070 --> 00:57.870
Now you can have different types of things.

00:58.530 --> 00:59.720
We'll start with the basic.

00:59.820 --> 01:07.680
And we're going to say that we're going to predict whether a class an input data point belongs to a

01:07.680 --> 01:08.090
class.

01:08.130 --> 01:11.780
But it does not belong to a class for instance you show the machine an image.

01:11.880 --> 01:15.660
And it says whether it is a cat yes or no.

01:15.690 --> 01:15.830
Right.

01:15.960 --> 01:17.520
So yes or no answers.

01:17.520 --> 01:23.550
So this is called a single class single class classification

01:26.550 --> 01:30.610
classification or simply classification.

01:30.630 --> 01:34.860
You can also have this scenario that here in which we ask which class does it belong to.

01:34.870 --> 01:38.660
And this is called a multi class classification.

01:39.090 --> 01:41.930
So many class classification or simply classification.

01:41.930 --> 01:42.190
Right.

01:42.190 --> 01:43.710
And you can have different types of things.

01:43.740 --> 01:45.730
Let's start with this guy over here.

01:45.750 --> 01:49.820
So we need to make two changes to our process of regression.

01:49.870 --> 01:56.280
So remember last time we didn't regression and we predicted real values.

01:56.320 --> 02:01.340
And so for instance the price of the House it could have been twenty nine point six nine.

02:01.350 --> 02:03.390
That would have made sense but classification.

02:03.400 --> 02:05.050
This is not going to make sense.

02:05.070 --> 02:07.920
So we need to make two changes to our processes.

02:09.060 --> 02:12.140
Let's draw our current situation over here.

02:12.170 --> 02:17.490
So we have this process over here and I'm going to draw a line over here because we had this guy as

02:17.490 --> 02:20.450
a linear equation right.

02:20.450 --> 02:23.760
So we're going to draw this as a straight line order.

02:23.840 --> 02:25.940
So this is simply a symbol for here.

02:25.990 --> 02:29.210
And what we gave it as an input was an X..

02:29.250 --> 02:29.450
Right.

02:29.450 --> 02:35.360
So some input and it predicted some y for us but we also had some model parameters over here.

02:35.390 --> 02:37.400
So we had a seat over here.

02:37.460 --> 02:45.620
So given an X and a t to predict in y for us now what we want to do is first of all we don't want this

02:46.190 --> 02:48.120
as a linear equation here.

02:48.140 --> 02:54.770
Because if what we get out of this if this continued equation and we give X for instance let's give

02:54.770 --> 03:01.760
it a fifty thousand as input and Tito was let's say Tito one was two we're going to get a very huge

03:01.760 --> 03:05.010
value out of it like a hundred thousand.

03:05.130 --> 03:09.800
Right so if we don't in standard please make sure you go back and put it in the equation so that you

03:09.800 --> 03:11.930
know what I'm talking about here.

03:12.030 --> 03:14.370
So what we have on here is a very large value.

03:14.420 --> 03:18.820
What we want to do is we want to predict whether something is or is not in a class.

03:18.890 --> 03:23.660
And for that what we want to do is we want to make sure that we fall in a specific range which is 0

03:23.660 --> 03:24.420
to 1.

03:25.260 --> 03:28.920
So this comes from probability but you don't really have to understand it at the moment.

03:29.030 --> 03:32.270
We want our output to be constrained between 0 and 1.

03:32.270 --> 03:38.670
So if we have the output somewhere over here and it's less than zero point five we're going to say no.

03:38.750 --> 03:42.700
And if it falls somewhere or here or here or here we're going to say yes.

03:42.700 --> 03:47.950
And so all of these motions over here I want to be yeses and all of these are going to be no's.

03:48.050 --> 03:48.420
Right.

03:49.070 --> 03:53.600
So for that we need to take this number and we want to squish it between 0 and 1.

03:54.050 --> 03:55.850
So there are a lot of squishing functions.

03:57.110 --> 03:59.930
So these are called squishing functions.

04:01.070 --> 04:09.190
And let's take an example of fun or here so this is a sigmoid function so this is the Orient zero comma

04:09.190 --> 04:09.520
zero.

04:10.120 --> 04:16.090
And this over here is plus infinity and this altogether is minus infinity so this x axis is the input

04:16.090 --> 04:24.700
value and we give let's say this input value and this function we give it a minus infinity it's going

04:24.700 --> 04:25.890
to return a zero.

04:25.910 --> 04:26.170
Right.

04:26.560 --> 04:29.830
So if you give it plus infinity it's going to return a one in the middle.

04:29.830 --> 04:31.420
It's going to show this behavior.

04:31.450 --> 04:34.070
So it's going to have a

04:37.090 --> 04:41.280
slightly gradually increasing line and this function is called sigmoid.

04:41.630 --> 04:43.380
So let's make sure we understand this.

04:44.370 --> 04:49.620
Let's say we got as an output over here minus one hundred thousand so that's going to be they were here

04:49.850 --> 04:50.050
right.

04:50.070 --> 04:52.260
So we're going to get a very small number over here.

04:52.260 --> 04:56.690
So this is I know let's call it zero point zero zero one.

04:56.730 --> 04:57.400
Right.

04:57.450 --> 05:04.620
If we give it on the other hand a zero let's say this Y predict what's predicted as being zero.

05:04.620 --> 05:08.940
So this going to go over here and this specific venue for sigmoid is zero point five.

05:08.940 --> 05:10.790
So we get zero point five out of it.

05:11.140 --> 05:17.170
Let's say if he gave it a very large number let's say over here to 10000 that we had earlier this is

05:17.180 --> 05:20.080
going to give us a number of very close to 1.

05:20.140 --> 05:22.770
Right so now we are squished between 0 and 1.

05:22.800 --> 05:27.180
We cannot have a value larger than larger than one because the sigmoid does not have a value larger

05:27.180 --> 05:28.030
than a month.

05:28.050 --> 05:31.070
So we have taken this linear equation.

05:31.110 --> 05:35.530
So what would what we have known here here is the same guy.

05:35.560 --> 05:38.730
So we're going to predict our linearity.

05:38.810 --> 05:43.350
Right so this median function is going to create something and then we're going to squishing.

05:43.590 --> 05:49.470
So that's how we droit it so you might have might have seen these symbols in machine learning literature

05:49.500 --> 05:51.660
or in deep learning codes.

05:51.690 --> 05:53.210
So this is what we draw.

05:53.210 --> 05:56.160
We're here because we have taken this why output and we have squashed it.

05:56.610 --> 06:00.180
Now once we squish it we're going to predict a zero.

06:00.360 --> 06:07.740
If this value after being squished is greater than zero point is less than three think that less than

06:08.100 --> 06:10.950
if it is less than zero point five.

06:10.950 --> 06:15.120
We're going to conduct a zero and it's greater than zero point five rather than or equal to zero point

06:15.120 --> 06:15.390
five.

06:15.390 --> 06:16.380
We're going to call it a 1.

06:16.980 --> 06:27.080
So now what we have is this process no longer outputs a real value right outputs either 0 or 1.

06:27.080 --> 06:27.350
Why.

06:27.350 --> 06:34.760
Because we have a 4.5 on here and as you 2.5 over here and we have squishing over here which produces

06:35.090 --> 06:37.020
a value between 0 and 1.

06:37.070 --> 06:39.550
So now we have this squished functional.

06:39.620 --> 06:42.350
And this is what we call classification.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.590
So the process remains the same.

06:45.620 --> 06:50.120
We give it some X. We give it some three does whatever the value is produced.

06:50.210 --> 06:57.250
We're going to change this to do with it fall within the range of zero point one zero and one and then

06:57.260 --> 07:00.690
we're going to see if the value is greater than zero point five we're going to say yes.

07:00.710 --> 07:04.550
So this guy over here if it's less than zero point five we're going to say no.

07:04.550 --> 07:06.330
So is this a cat.

07:06.410 --> 07:08.810
If you come over here we can't say yes it's a cat.

07:08.810 --> 07:11.120
If you come over here we say no it's not a cat.

07:11.750 --> 07:16.650
So that's essentially what classification classification is doing in terms of progression.

07:16.760 --> 07:21.910
Obviously our error is going to change but we don't have to worry about that right now.

07:23.150 --> 07:28.920
So now that you have this one building block over here let's go ahead and combine a couple of these.

07:29.030 --> 07:35.110
So we have this guy over here and we have an X going in and we have a Theta going in.

07:35.960 --> 07:40.820
So let's leave this guy out here and come on here and create another theta.

07:40.860 --> 07:42.460
Another squishing function.

07:42.530 --> 07:45.160
So this same X is going to come over here.

07:45.370 --> 07:50.680
Right we're going to input the same X to here but we're going to have a different data for this guy.

07:50.680 --> 07:50.830
Right.

07:50.960 --> 07:54.680
So because this data and this data are different next on this one.

07:54.710 --> 07:57.660
And that's called this too because these two are different.

07:57.710 --> 08:00.560
This is going to produce different behaviors.

08:01.240 --> 08:04.310
So these outputs are going to be different.

08:04.430 --> 08:13.100
Now when we have these different outputs what we can do is we can take these and plug them in to another

08:13.810 --> 08:15.030
switching function.

08:15.410 --> 08:21.410
And what this is going to do is it's going to take the output of these guys and create that that is

08:21.410 --> 08:25.380
the input and it's going to produce its own capital here.

08:25.670 --> 08:34.940
What this does is it takes this X and decides some sort of behavior of X and this guy decides some other

08:34.940 --> 08:38.390
sort of relationship between X and the output.

08:39.260 --> 08:47.130
And based on these two different outputs this guy is going to give them weights.

08:47.300 --> 08:53.940
Think of it this way this guy over here is our senior detective.

08:54.120 --> 08:54.360
Right.

08:54.950 --> 08:59.030
So now the senior detective is really good at solving crimes.

08:59.030 --> 09:00.380
But how does he work.

09:00.380 --> 09:03.430
He takes some information from the medical examiner.

09:07.100 --> 09:09.910
Who is capable of dissecting the body.

09:09.920 --> 09:15.000
Finding out what chemicals are in the body and all that biology stuff right.

09:15.080 --> 09:20.420
I'm not sure what that is but a medical examiner essentially performs the autopsy and finds out the

09:20.420 --> 09:22.070
cause of death and all that stuff.

09:22.070 --> 09:24.530
This guy over here is our detective.

09:24.650 --> 09:31.820
So the junior guy who goes out goes out and collects the evidence is from the scene talks to the witnesses

09:31.850 --> 09:32.420
on that stuff.

09:32.810 --> 09:38.660
So this guy is not aware of the information that is over here and this guy does not know what the detective

09:38.660 --> 09:39.250
is doing.

09:39.350 --> 09:44.900
But they both provide some input to the senior detective and this senior detective has some of its own

09:44.900 --> 09:46.500
parameters over here.

09:46.910 --> 09:47.200
Right.

09:47.210 --> 09:49.540
So it has some of its own parameters over here.

09:49.550 --> 09:55.210
And based on those two parameters and the inputs that it is getting from the two different sources it's

09:55.220 --> 09:56.900
able to make a good decision.

09:56.990 --> 10:01.370
So let's call it a good decision right.

10:01.740 --> 10:12.590
So think of it this way a two level machine that we have all here is somehow divided into low level

10:12.590 --> 10:13.220
information

10:18.180 --> 10:22.200
and these two are not going to communicate with each other right.

10:22.380 --> 10:27.260
Whereas this guy receives information from all of them and can make high level decisions.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.850
So this guy can make high level decisions

10:34.080 --> 10:38.280
because it's able to offload some of the work to these low level workers.

10:38.280 --> 10:50.300
So essentially what we have essentially what we have over here is a deep network you'll see where the

10:50.660 --> 10:52.780
concept of deep neural network comes from.

10:52.790 --> 10:57.860
So this over here is a deep network because we have what it's not technically deep.

10:57.860 --> 10:59.800
At the moment between make it deep in a minute.

10:59.840 --> 11:03.650
So we have this guy over here and then we have this go here.

11:03.650 --> 11:05.560
So it's a it's a deep hierarchy right.

11:05.570 --> 11:11.000
So yeah this guy and it's talking to these two people and this guy in turn is talking to these two guys

11:11.000 --> 11:13.920
and this is talking to these two and so on and so forth.

11:13.920 --> 11:14.120
Right.

11:14.120 --> 11:16.160
So it becomes a very deep hierarchy.

11:16.160 --> 11:21.320
And if you turn this around this is going to turn into this go here.

11:21.500 --> 11:25.810
This leads to deep neural networks and deep learning so this is what we have all here.

11:25.830 --> 11:27.170
You mean all the details.

11:27.170 --> 11:29.030
So this guy over here is our ex.

11:29.030 --> 11:30.800
So it's going to have different values.

11:30.800 --> 11:37.670
We only have one feature earlier on but now we can have one two three four five six seven eight different

11:37.670 --> 11:38.790
values going in.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.970
And this is our medical examiner.

11:40.970 --> 11:43.060
This guy Woodhead is a detective.

11:43.130 --> 11:49.160
This guy over here is probably some other agency that can provide us more information.

11:49.160 --> 11:51.930
And this is one level deep.

11:52.070 --> 11:53.650
And then we have further down the line.

11:53.660 --> 11:56.650
And finally we have some people that here this one guy over here.

11:56.660 --> 12:02.960
This is the senior detective that said that yes this is a cat and I'm fairly sure because I got the

12:02.960 --> 12:04.830
value out as you point eight.

12:04.960 --> 12:08.770
Now this guy over here is another senior executive.

12:08.870 --> 12:09.830
And as you know Detective.

12:10.160 --> 12:15.530
And based on all the different values that you got from overhead it decides that it's a dog.

12:15.660 --> 12:20.610
Now he says that this is with a confidence zero point seven.

12:20.620 --> 12:22.540
This guy says that it's a car.

12:22.570 --> 12:22.780
Right.

12:22.800 --> 12:26.490
So car but he's not really sure.

12:26.490 --> 12:26.760
Right.

12:26.800 --> 12:36.270
So somebody put him and this guy over here says that it's let's say a bear zero point six.

12:36.290 --> 12:41.990
So now we have these four guys over here and everybody says like this guy does not say that it's a car

12:41.990 --> 12:42.220
right.

12:42.270 --> 12:43.300
It's less than 2.5.

12:43.300 --> 12:49.980
So this is out of the race but we do have these three guys over here and this is saying as you pointed

12:49.990 --> 12:52.090
this things in point seven of the things you point six.

12:52.090 --> 12:59.080
What we do is we take the max and we say because this guy is the most confident this is most probably

12:59.140 --> 13:00.170
a cat.

13:00.290 --> 13:00.430
Right.

13:00.460 --> 13:05.340
So that is what we have all here in terms of making the final decisions.

13:05.350 --> 13:08.350
And this is called a soft Max.

13:08.540 --> 13:12.920
So Max I already explained it's called a soft because we do a little bit of computation over here but

13:12.920 --> 13:13.820
that's not really important.

13:13.820 --> 13:18.470
What's important is that the output the maximum protect we get out of it.

13:18.500 --> 13:24.350
So after squishing we don't apply the threshold what we do is we simply operate the value instead of

13:24.350 --> 13:30.050
saying yes or no we say your point eight and whatever the largest value is we pick that as the class.

13:30.050 --> 13:32.300
So now this we have multi class classification

13:35.040 --> 13:38.370
multi class classification instead of just one class.

13:38.370 --> 13:45.030
Now we can predict many classes and we have the suffix for these two new concepts have been produced

13:45.150 --> 13:45.640
on this.

13:45.640 --> 13:51.340
We're here now because we have this guy and this guy over here and also over here.

13:51.360 --> 13:54.750
This is our output and this is our input.

13:54.750 --> 14:00.000
We have what are called hidden layers just as we had head there over here.

14:00.000 --> 14:13.500
So this was our head layer and if you have more than one hidden layers these are called Deep newer networks.

14:14.650 --> 14:15.660
So there you have it.

14:15.850 --> 14:18.190
Deep Neural Networks in half an hour.

14:19.000 --> 14:26.350
Now I have skipped obviously a lot of theoretical details but this if you understand all of this completely

14:26.500 --> 14:29.290
this should be sufficient to get you started with quite a lot of code.
