00:00.270 --> 00:03.080
Let's quickly recap what we've seen in the past couple of videos.

00:03.210 --> 00:11.590
So we started with this basic understanding of fitting a line on a model by manipulating the model parameters.

00:11.820 --> 00:18.030
And the idea was to reduce an error at the end of the final model so that we have the optimum values

00:18.030 --> 00:19.530
for the model parameters.

00:19.530 --> 00:21.330
So that essentially gone Fitting the model.

00:21.330 --> 00:27.140
And that is what we did over here in this basic beauty portion of our code.

00:27.250 --> 00:33.540
Then we went ahead and decided that we wanted to do classification which is a yes or no answer either

00:33.540 --> 00:39.420
for one class which is called a classification in binary classification or for multiple classes which

00:39.420 --> 00:41.000
is multi class classification.

00:41.070 --> 00:46.230
Then we saw how this classification model simple classification model can be used in conjunction with

00:46.230 --> 00:52.980
other models to convert it into a deep neural network which is able to make high level decisions as

00:52.980 --> 00:58.140
opposed to the simple decisions that can be made by a basic classification model.

00:58.140 --> 01:04.470
Finally we took a look at how we can create deep neural networks by having multiple hidden layers.

01:04.680 --> 01:07.210
And we took a look at the multi class classification.

01:07.290 --> 01:11.270
Now as I mentioned again and again this course is only an introductory course.

01:12.090 --> 01:16.620
And we don't want to go into the theory too much because I have seen again and again that when you're

01:16.710 --> 01:21.870
just getting an introduction to machine learning going into too much to read without code really hurts

01:21.870 --> 01:23.160
your progress.

01:23.160 --> 01:28.080
So in this course we're going to keep the tool to a minimum and that is essentially all the theory that

01:28.080 --> 01:29.030
we're going to do.

01:29.040 --> 01:34.230
However when you're done with the course you do want to understand the mathematics behind the machine

01:34.230 --> 01:35.280
learning models.

01:35.280 --> 01:37.640
If you really want to get an understanding of that.

01:37.650 --> 01:43.350
So what I'm going to do is I'm not going to cover the details of the theory within this course but once

01:43.350 --> 01:48.390
you go through this code and you have gone through all the codes that are necessary for the understanding

01:48.390 --> 01:55.080
of your networks I want you to go back and take a look at this deep learning talk which was a very applied

01:55.080 --> 01:58.500
talk that I gave last year.

01:58.500 --> 02:02.070
This is available completely free of cost.

02:02.280 --> 02:05.660
If you go to this you are I'll bet at least practice.

02:05.790 --> 02:13.170
So this is a talk given by me to a university audience and this is a little bit math heavy but it covers

02:13.200 --> 02:19.760
all the mathematical background that is necessary to go from what we have in this course up to whatever

02:19.770 --> 02:22.400
is necessary for understanding everything else.

02:22.470 --> 02:28.230
So I highly recommend that you go over there to this you are and take a look at the approximately one

02:28.230 --> 02:33.300
and a half hour free dog which takes a look at all the mathematical details that we've missed in this

02:33.300 --> 02:33.850
course.

02:33.850 --> 02:35.460
So again it's free.

02:35.460 --> 02:38.790
You don't have to pay for the video you just go over to the viewer and watch it.

02:38.880 --> 02:43.050
So I highly recommend you do that after you have gone through this course in detail.
