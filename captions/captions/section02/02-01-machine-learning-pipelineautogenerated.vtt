00:00.360 --> 00:01.640
Hi and welcome back.

00:01.650 --> 00:04.610
Please make sure you've covered the good that we did in the last section.

00:04.650 --> 00:05.960
So this is a practical course.

00:05.960 --> 00:07.820
It will benefit you the most if you do the good.

00:07.830 --> 00:11.160
As we go along instead of waiting till the end of the course.

00:11.190 --> 00:15.160
So anyway let's start with a little bit of definition of machine learning.

00:15.240 --> 00:20.310
We're going to skirt away from the philosophical aspects of what learning is and where the machines

00:20.310 --> 00:21.390
can learn or not.

00:21.390 --> 00:24.870
We're going to define machine learning in a much much more practical way.

00:24.870 --> 00:31.530
So we'll define it as adapting to perform a task in a better way with expedients so better is going

00:31.530 --> 00:33.940
to be according to some measures we'll come to that in a minute.

00:33.990 --> 00:39.240
Also we're going to have some experiences because of which the machine is going to perform the task

00:39.420 --> 00:40.500
better.

00:40.530 --> 00:46.740
So that's going to be our working definition and essentially that is what's going to help us do a lot

00:46.740 --> 00:48.270
of things now.

00:48.600 --> 00:52.720
It should come to your mind what deep learning is if you're not really familiar with deep learning.

00:52.950 --> 00:57.720
It's an algorithm in machine learning so the general aspect is machine learning and the specific concept

00:57.720 --> 01:00.020
is the algorithm of deep learning.

01:00.180 --> 01:03.390
And this algorithm has shown immense levels of success.

01:03.390 --> 01:06.850
So in a couple of minutes we'll get to deep learning really quickly.

01:06.990 --> 01:12.400
But the essence to understand is that it's not as difficult as people make it out to be.

01:12.420 --> 01:16.020
It's a very simple concept to get started with.

01:16.020 --> 01:18.070
It's a lot easier than other models.

01:18.120 --> 01:22.950
It's a little difficult to understand why it works but we don't have to understand the why for it to

01:22.950 --> 01:25.220
start working for us in real life.

01:25.260 --> 01:30.600
So keep that in mind that even though nobody really understands how deep learning works.

01:30.780 --> 01:33.370
That's not stopping us from getting benefit from it.

01:33.420 --> 01:35.210
So what can you do.

01:35.210 --> 01:39.230
What kind of benefits can you get from deep learning and machine learning in general.

01:39.270 --> 01:44.020
So for instance you can expect a you can predict the expected selling price of a house.

01:44.040 --> 01:48.580
So this is going to be predicting a real value.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.760
So real no value.

01:52.050 --> 02:00.270
So by the way I use this pen tablet because it has the it has been shown that doing annotations on screen

02:00.360 --> 02:01.740
helps students learn.

02:02.040 --> 02:07.320
So this is not me trying to get away from animating my slides.

02:07.470 --> 02:12.060
It really does benefit the students a lot more if we do annotations as we speak.

02:12.060 --> 02:17.760
We can also predict whether a patient has cancer given the information that we have about the patient

02:17.760 --> 02:19.660
for instance their C.T. scans.

02:19.680 --> 02:23.380
So this is going to be predicting a discrete value.

02:23.390 --> 02:23.600
Right.

02:23.610 --> 02:27.940
So a discrete value meaning it's either going to be yes or no.

02:27.940 --> 02:30.390
Right so there's nothing in between.

02:30.390 --> 02:36.540
We can also predict whether the image that we're seeing is of an aeroplane or a car.

02:36.570 --> 02:41.670
So this essentially is going to be discrete as well except we're going to have car or plane.

02:41.850 --> 02:42.200
Right.

02:42.690 --> 02:48.210
So we can also predict what is on the top flight of a scenic image that we're seeing whether it's a

02:48.210 --> 02:53.390
tree or a bird or a cloudy sky.

02:53.460 --> 02:55.400
So we can predict different things.

02:55.470 --> 03:00.540
We can also predict how many topics we can categorize or document in things we can predict what the

03:00.540 --> 03:01.920
user wants to read next.

03:01.920 --> 03:06.870
So all of these different types of things we can predict and essentially they all fall into a couple

03:06.870 --> 03:07.770
of different areas.

03:07.770 --> 03:11.420
For instance we can have a regression.

03:11.910 --> 03:18.720
So regression is going to be the idea of predicting real values.

03:18.800 --> 03:18.990
Right.

03:19.020 --> 03:25.340
So continuous values and we can have classification

03:27.940 --> 03:32.110
so classification essentially means that we're going to have discrete values

03:37.510 --> 03:43.390
and we're going to start with regression in general regression and classification fall into the general

03:43.390 --> 03:45.940
category of supervised learning.

03:46.420 --> 03:51.460
So we're going to what we're going to do is we're going to take some sort of data and we're going to

03:51.460 --> 03:57.610
teach the machine what it means is that the machine is going to have a teacher and the machine is going

03:57.610 --> 03:58.800
to act as a student.

03:58.810 --> 04:04.420
So this is the easiest machine learning algorithm to get started with or the paradigm to get started

04:04.420 --> 04:10.330
with unsupervised learning has shown a lot of potential but that's not going to be covered in this particular

04:10.330 --> 04:11.740
course anyway.

04:12.010 --> 04:17.460
So let's start with the learning process what happens in supervised learning as I mentioned.

04:17.500 --> 04:21.670
Because it's supervised we're going to have some sort of data through which we're going to teach the

04:21.680 --> 04:27.660
machine what we do is we take the data and we split it in two portions.

04:27.730 --> 04:33.710
So we take one of those portions and we essentially create a training set.

04:33.760 --> 04:39.190
So this is going to be called a training set a training set essentially means that this is a set of

04:39.370 --> 04:40.470
data points right.

04:40.480 --> 04:45.700
So let's say we have 100 data points in our data set.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.070
So we take 70 of these and the set of these is going to be called a training set.

04:50.760 --> 04:55.150
Now what we do is we take this training set and we feed it to some process.

04:55.150 --> 04:58.150
So we're going to treat this as a black box at the moment.

04:58.180 --> 05:04.580
And so this is a black box which means we're not going to concern ourselves with how this works.

05:04.620 --> 05:04.800
Right.

05:04.810 --> 05:08.880
So there's going to be some process and that process is going to give us an H.

05:08.890 --> 05:09.100
Right.

05:09.100 --> 05:15.280
So this H is a function function in the sense you can think of it as a programming function for the

05:15.280 --> 05:21.490
moment and what it does is it takes an input and it produces an output.

05:21.610 --> 05:23.730
Remember this portion over here that we left out.

05:23.740 --> 05:27.220
Now we're going to take this portion over here and treat that as a test set.

05:27.220 --> 05:30.130
So this is going to be the exam that we give to the machine.

05:30.130 --> 05:38.440
So the this portion or here and was straining the machine in order to help it predict the outputs given

05:38.440 --> 05:39.270
the inputs.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.080
Now we take some of the inputs.

05:41.080 --> 05:45.020
These are the test set data points.

05:45.040 --> 05:50.800
What this means is we never showed the answer to these data points to the machine and now we feed it

05:50.800 --> 05:55.140
to this edge function and this edge function is going to make a prediction.

05:55.210 --> 06:01.610
Now if this prediction matches with are real values over here the values that we know are true.

06:01.950 --> 06:05.900
So the values that we know are true those are called crown jewels.

06:06.070 --> 06:10.500
So a ground truth is the value that we know to be true.

06:10.510 --> 06:22.990
So for instance I can say that a house that has five bedrooms goes far ten thousand dollars.

06:23.080 --> 06:23.380
Right.

06:23.440 --> 06:24.400
So that's not realistic.

06:24.400 --> 06:32.250
But let's assume I'm in some cheaper market so I should this number over here.

06:32.290 --> 06:41.680
So five goes in and this edge produces let's say nine hundred and eighty nine thousand eight hundred

06:42.460 --> 06:43.080
dollars.

06:43.080 --> 06:43.320
Right.

06:43.330 --> 06:45.420
So it's not accurate.

06:45.450 --> 06:47.680
It's not correct but it's good enough.

06:47.710 --> 06:48.490
Right.

06:48.520 --> 06:52.960
So what we're going to do is we're going to take this prediction and compare it with our ground truth.

06:53.070 --> 06:57.940
So this over here 10000 is our ground truth and we're going to predict and compare it with the prediction

06:58.480 --> 07:07.820
if the prediction and then round truth are close together so if the output is close to the prediction

07:10.110 --> 07:12.350
we say that the machine has learned right.

07:12.810 --> 07:18.840
So if not then we need to train the machine a bit more or reaching in need to change our process over

07:18.840 --> 07:21.000
here take another process.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.340
So that's essentially what happens now.

07:24.320 --> 07:31.460
Once you have this edge over here you no longer need the training set and the process because we have

07:31.460 --> 07:32.640
the edge.

07:32.710 --> 07:39.290
So now this edge of that function and we can take our test set and we give it to edge and it can make

07:39.290 --> 07:39.860
the predictions.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.100
We don't need the whole portion over here.

07:42.110 --> 07:46.280
Now this is going to be really important when you do practical machine learning because this portion

07:46.290 --> 07:49.400
over here is going to be computer intensive.

07:49.400 --> 07:53.640
You need heavy machinery to carry out this portion of that here.

07:53.680 --> 07:54.110
Right.

07:54.380 --> 07:58.730
So this is going to be very very very difficult on a mobile for instance.

07:58.730 --> 07:59.990
But once you have etch.

08:00.110 --> 08:01.520
This is a very lightweight function

08:04.560 --> 08:09.050
and this lightweight function can be deployed on an FPGA.

08:09.060 --> 08:12.890
You can deploy it on a mobile device you can deploy it on Raspberry Pi.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.710
Any machine that you can think of really.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.270
So you don't even need the dataset anymore.

08:18.350 --> 08:24.010
So all you're going to have is an edge over here and eventually you even get rid of

08:27.160 --> 08:28.180
the desert.

08:28.510 --> 08:29.970
And your predictions.

08:30.140 --> 08:30.640
Right.

08:30.730 --> 08:35.160
So all you have is an edge and you can deploy that edge to another machine.

08:35.170 --> 08:40.360
So now this looks a little bit intensive but we're going to do is what we're going to do is we're going

08:40.360 --> 08:44.130
to move ahead and give you an example of regression.

08:44.200 --> 08:47.260
So we're trying to predict a real valued output.

08:47.890 --> 08:53.950
And in this real valued output problem we're going to have a continuous output and we're going to take

08:53.950 --> 08:59.350
the example of housing prices so this is a very common example in machine learning and it's very easy

08:59.350 --> 09:04.210
to understand because it has only one type of input that we give to the machine.

09:04.240 --> 09:09.340
So in the next video we're going to take a look at regression and how we can apply this process over

09:09.340 --> 09:13.330
here that we just saw in a local media statement.
