WEBVTT

00:00.830 --> 00:01.160
All right.

00:01.180 --> 00:02.660
So we're back after the break.

00:02.680 --> 00:05.390
We're going to take a look at the example of regression.

00:05.470 --> 00:10.760
And we're going to start from the very scratch and look at every detail that we need to know.

00:11.290 --> 00:13.840
So we're going to have this dataset.

00:13.840 --> 00:16.780
So this is our data set.

00:16.780 --> 00:18.940
This over here is our input.

00:18.950 --> 00:19.340
All right.

00:19.360 --> 00:23.250
So we're only going to give the machine one input that is going to be area of the house.

00:23.270 --> 00:28.330
Square feet and we're going to give it a number of examples.

00:28.630 --> 00:35.400
So these examples are going to be called data points so we have hard data is it hard data points.

00:35.400 --> 00:36.470
We have our inputs.

00:36.600 --> 00:41.220
And this over here is our output that the machine is supposed to learn to predict.

00:41.790 --> 00:47.730
So for instance we have these three examples over here we can take two examples and we can put this

00:47.790 --> 00:48.900
in the training set

00:51.850 --> 00:57.000
and take this score here and we're going to put it in the test.

00:57.190 --> 01:02.920
Obviously if you're going to have a real machine learning algorithm or an example we need to have these

01:02.920 --> 01:06.310
like 30000 over here and 20000 over here.

01:06.310 --> 01:08.800
But the concept is going to remain the same.

01:08.800 --> 01:08.970
Right.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.790
So we take this dataset over here and we take some of the points at string set and then what we do is

01:16.130 --> 01:24.250
we go over here and we plot it on the x axis we're going to have are here and on the y axis and we're

01:24.250 --> 01:26.930
going to have our price.

01:27.010 --> 01:35.410
So first let's try to think about the machine the machine first does is it takes the price and the area

01:35.530 --> 01:38.140
and it plots all the data points that we showed it.

01:38.140 --> 01:38.320
Right.

01:38.320 --> 01:44.540
So these values you can ignore for the moment it's not really important what the exact values are.

01:44.740 --> 01:50.590
You can get rid of these and you can plot all of the different values that we have in our data point.

01:50.740 --> 01:50.940
Right.

01:50.950 --> 01:55.630
So once we have these different data points over here what we want to do is we want to predict what

01:55.630 --> 02:01.530
the relationship is between the area and the price if we know what the relationship is.

02:01.540 --> 02:07.220
What we can do is we can simply plug in the area in that relationship equation and get the price up

02:07.750 --> 02:09.800
seems freely straightforward.

02:09.860 --> 02:10.090
Right.

02:10.690 --> 02:14.950
It's not that straightforward but it's a good enough approximation to start with.

02:14.980 --> 02:21.220
So let's assume first that the relationship between the area and the price is linear.

02:21.220 --> 02:22.320
So what does that mean.

02:22.330 --> 02:27.730
It means that the price is equal to some number.

02:27.730 --> 02:35.560
A plus B of any so we multiply the area by some number.

02:35.560 --> 02:37.960
And then we add some number and we get the price.

02:37.990 --> 02:39.820
So this one a linear relationship.

02:39.920 --> 02:45.820
Now since this looks a little bit too long look we're going to do is we're going to change this price

02:45.820 --> 02:46.590
too wide.

02:47.710 --> 02:54.190
All right we're going to change this area to X and we get the simple equation of.

02:54.190 --> 02:56.650
Is it wise to A plus B X.

02:56.710 --> 02:59.890
Now this is the straight line equation

03:04.690 --> 03:07.880
straight line equation.

03:08.080 --> 03:08.320
Right.

03:08.740 --> 03:12.500
And these two things are what we need to figure out.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.150
We already know all the excess.

03:14.170 --> 03:15.560
We already know all the whys.

03:15.580 --> 03:15.760
Right.

03:15.790 --> 03:18.180
So we got them in the data center we're here.

03:18.430 --> 03:21.610
Now what we need to do is find out what a and b are.

03:21.700 --> 03:29.590
So what this does is for instance like let's take two values let's assume that the value of e is equal

03:29.590 --> 03:30.660
to over here.

03:30.690 --> 03:39.850
That's in scoreless twenty five and let's say the slope of this line is let's say two point nine.

03:40.450 --> 03:44.620
So the value of eight is going to be twenty five and the value B's going to be two point nine.

03:44.620 --> 03:49.790
So this is the slope so me over here is the slope.

03:49.890 --> 03:56.750
So let's go ahead and take that I turn this over here is the slope.

03:57.580 --> 04:03.020
So this basically says if we change X how much is y going to change.

04:03.060 --> 04:06.350
So if we change X by one unit how much is y going to change.

04:06.370 --> 04:12.260
So let's say if B is 2 and we have is equal to 4.

04:12.520 --> 04:16.150
So it is going to be four plus two into x.

04:16.240 --> 04:17.860
So that's an example.

04:17.860 --> 04:19.630
Why is it good for us to into x.

04:19.750 --> 04:27.460
So if X was to vote we're going to have Y as two into two is four plus four is eight.

04:27.850 --> 04:33.220
If we change this to three it's going to be three into two teams going to do which is when the sixth

04:33.240 --> 04:39.270
before you wouldn't think what they says is if you change X by 1 y changes by 2.

04:39.270 --> 04:44.700
And that is going to be the slope over here which is B and the value of B is two.

04:44.920 --> 04:51.490
So I apologize if I'm boring you with all the details but it's it's really helpful if you understand

04:51.490 --> 04:53.190
this theory a little bit.

04:53.740 --> 04:58.280
So you can skip ahead if you find this too easy to understand right.

04:59.410 --> 05:00.640
So anyway let's go ahead.

05:00.790 --> 05:08.230
So we got the slope over here and we got the gate and this essentially means that if you set X to zero

05:08.260 --> 05:10.250
then where does the Y stand.

05:10.290 --> 05:13.650
So if X is equal to zero Y is going to be over here.

05:13.650 --> 05:13.810
Right.

05:13.840 --> 05:20.140
So this is the y intercept anyway so let's get back to our line here.

05:20.140 --> 05:21.240
So we have this line over here.

05:21.250 --> 05:25.440
And if you look at this line it does not look like it's a good fit for these points.

05:25.570 --> 05:30.940
The points are going somewhere else and if this was our prediction and we wanted to predict the value

05:30.940 --> 05:35.920
of y over here this would be our prediction whereas Y is way over here right.

05:36.250 --> 05:38.650
We'd be wrong for almost all the different points right.

05:38.680 --> 05:44.550
So these would be our predictions and almost all of the points that we may be far away from our prediction.

05:45.250 --> 05:52.510
So what we want to do is we want to figure out a way of changing this line from here to let's say over

05:52.510 --> 05:53.170
here.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.230
So this looks a lot better still.

05:55.260 --> 06:00.100
Our prediction is going to be off for this guy over here and it's going to be off for this guy over

06:00.100 --> 06:03.960
here and this is going to be off a little bit here a little bit here.

06:03.970 --> 06:06.310
So we still have problems over here.

06:06.610 --> 06:10.280
But as you can notice the problems aren't all that bad.

06:10.450 --> 06:11.140
So ahead.

06:11.170 --> 06:14.030
This individual was all the way wrong here.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.030
So this is very wrong.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.160
This is very wrong.

06:16.300 --> 06:19.140
A lot lot more longer than over here.

06:19.150 --> 06:20.240
That's not a word.

06:20.240 --> 06:22.770
But you know what I mean.

06:22.780 --> 06:23.020
Right.

06:23.860 --> 06:24.610
So anyway.

06:24.610 --> 06:25.490
Which one is better.

06:25.570 --> 06:30.400
You tell me it looks to me like this guy over here is better right.

06:30.490 --> 06:38.260
So let's go all the way back over here to our definition of machine learning and realize.

06:38.290 --> 06:38.560
Right.

06:38.560 --> 06:40.710
So better what is better.

06:40.750 --> 06:45.190
So he said according to some measure let's go ahead and find out what the measure of what it is.

06:45.190 --> 06:47.170
Let's formalize our thinking.

06:47.170 --> 06:48.370
What are we saying.

06:48.640 --> 06:51.280
Why are we saying that this second line this blue line is better.

06:51.280 --> 06:57.010
It's better because the these lines over here the error lines the difference between our prediction

06:57.100 --> 06:59.440
and what the real world data says.

06:59.440 --> 07:00.650
Those are smaller.

07:00.790 --> 07:03.950
So the smaller the lines the better the fit.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.330
So that's why we use the word fit over here so we're fitting the line.

07:07.450 --> 07:12.660
So let's write that a ill fitting in the line.

07:12.840 --> 07:13.160
Right.

07:13.410 --> 07:16.480
So I'm putting the line over the data points.

07:16.480 --> 07:19.450
Now what we have over here are some errors.

07:19.660 --> 07:23.810
Let's collect these errors in a specific formula.

07:23.890 --> 07:27.220
So let's go over here and say let's take this one point over here.

07:27.220 --> 07:28.850
So this is our prediction over here.

07:28.870 --> 07:31.470
Let's call this my prime.

07:31.720 --> 07:33.430
So we have a prime over here.

07:33.800 --> 07:34.560
All right.

07:34.570 --> 07:37.850
And what we're trying to do is we're trying to find out the difference between these two.

07:38.120 --> 07:39.760
So why prime minus the Y.

07:40.600 --> 07:43.000
So this over here is our white prime.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.790
So this is our prediction.

07:45.230 --> 07:49.960
And this over here is our real world value.

07:49.960 --> 07:52.830
The one that we got from our data set.

07:53.230 --> 07:57.860
So now we have our prediction and the real world value which is our ground truth.

07:57.910 --> 07:58.720
The expectation.

07:58.720 --> 08:06.970
So whatever the difference between these two is now if this Y is more than the real value it's bad.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.180
If it's less than the real world value it's equally bad.

08:09.360 --> 08:11.440
So we don't care what the difference between the two is.

08:11.440 --> 08:14.510
So what we can do is we can go ahead and square it.

08:14.530 --> 08:17.920
So if you square it if you've got this number to be let's say minus two.

08:18.100 --> 08:22.750
This way to turn into four and if the number of us to this is also going to turn into four.

08:22.770 --> 08:26.530
Right so we get rid of the essentially the minus sign over here.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.960
When we come back to why we need that in a minute.

08:30.310 --> 08:36.100
So now we have this difference between our prediction and the expectation.

08:36.130 --> 08:39.530
We also want to consider all of the different points.

08:39.610 --> 08:44.590
So what we're going to do is we're going to sum over from ICE equal to zero to.

08:44.740 --> 08:55.850
So this M is going to be the number of data points that we have so number of data points right.

08:56.420 --> 09:01.490
So this is our number of data points and we're going to some or all of these different things.

09:02.270 --> 09:05.390
What if we have a million data points this value is going to be quite large.

09:05.390 --> 09:08.990
If you have only 10000 that's going to add this value is going to be small.

09:08.990 --> 09:14.240
So what we want to do is we want to take away this and this m effect over here and multiply that by

09:14.420 --> 09:15.130
one over.

09:15.350 --> 09:15.640
Right.

09:16.040 --> 09:25.130
So now we have an equation over here which essentially gives us the specifics of this better.

09:25.130 --> 09:30.840
So if this value is small we're going to say that the D lines are better.

09:30.940 --> 09:31.190
Right.

09:31.550 --> 09:36.770
So if you draw a line and then we compute this whole thing over here and it gives us let's say 20 minus

09:36.770 --> 09:43.470
20 20 and then we draw another line and that gives us 40 we're going to say that this line is better.

09:43.490 --> 09:44.470
Why is it better.

09:44.570 --> 09:49.430
Because the errors are much much smaller and the aggregate of the errors of the average of the errors

09:49.850 --> 09:54.950
or the mean of the errors which errors squared errors

09:57.820 --> 09:58.120
right.

09:58.150 --> 10:02.170
So the mean squared errors are much much smaller.

10:02.170 --> 10:05.200
And that's that means that it's a better fit right.

10:05.200 --> 10:09.100
So this is called a root meaning squared error.

10:09.390 --> 10:12.080
So if you put an untruth over there.

10:13.090 --> 10:17.920
If you put it under the door then that is when to turn it into a root means where all you're going to

10:17.920 --> 10:19.360
see mean square.

10:19.510 --> 10:27.370
Right now that's a lot to take in but that covers a lot of ground in terms of understanding machine

10:27.370 --> 10:30.280
learning so make sure you go back and understand all of this.

10:30.280 --> 10:36.430
If you have any questions at all please come back to me asking the questions I'd be happy to help and

10:36.520 --> 10:41.920
make sure you understand this if you understand these portions or hear machine learning and code and

10:41.920 --> 10:45.410
everything else is going to be a lot easier for you down the line.

10:47.490 --> 10:51.030
Let's summarize this and finish off this video.

10:51.480 --> 10:57.530
So what we're going to do is we're going to change R A's and B's do theta zero and theta one right.

10:57.540 --> 11:00.190
So these are essentially a and b the same thing right.

11:00.210 --> 11:01.680
No difference.

11:01.680 --> 11:06.870
We're just calling them as you know and theta one because we're going to have quite a few and essentially

11:06.870 --> 11:13.290
they're going to go into a very large number greater than 26 or Alphabet is not going to be enough for

11:13.290 --> 11:13.940
us.

11:13.950 --> 11:20.720
So these two things over here these need to be identified this X remember is fixed on here.

11:20.760 --> 11:23.340
This overhead is what we call my prime right.

11:23.340 --> 11:24.350
So this is a prediction.

11:24.360 --> 11:28.120
So let's call it etch teed off.

11:28.260 --> 11:36.780
So let's call this etch is for hypothesis on hypothesis given the values of theaters which are all here

11:37.620 --> 11:39.820
for a particular input x.

11:39.840 --> 11:42.150
So this is going to be equal to my right.

11:42.230 --> 11:44.990
So this over here.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.260
This whole thing over here is are what is called a model.

11:50.370 --> 11:51.840
So this is a model.

11:51.840 --> 11:58.460
These are the models parameters.

11:58.830 --> 12:01.590
So this is obviously the input.

12:02.370 --> 12:07.060
And this is our prediction.

12:07.830 --> 12:15.620
And what we're trying to do is we're trying to fit the model and what that means is we're trying to

12:15.620 --> 12:23.540
find the values of these model parameters such that our error is minimized

12:27.170 --> 12:28.880
points for error is minimized.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.730
That's what we're trying to do.

12:30.800 --> 12:34.010
So we have I think we have prediction.

12:34.010 --> 12:36.350
We have our parameters and we have our model here.

12:36.710 --> 12:41.750
So that is essentially all the terminology that you need to have in order to understand machine learning

12:41.750 --> 12:50.150
literature all the other things will come along as we go as we proceed with our course in the next video

12:50.240 --> 12:56.870
we're going to take a look at how we can change this really valued output into classes and then cover

12:56.990 --> 13:00.770
the more interesting areas of machine learning such just classifications.
